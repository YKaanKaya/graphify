## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for the **GraphFlow ETL Suite (GFES)**, a new product designed to significantly simplify and automate the process of extracting data from traditional tabular databases (like relational databases), transforming it according to a target graph schema, and loading it into various graph database platforms.

### 1.2. Problem Statement
Organizations are increasingly recognizing the power of graph databases for analyzing complex relationships within their data (e.g., social networks, fraud detection, recommendation engines, knowledge graphs). However, migrating existing data from established tabular systems into a graph model is a significant hurdle. Current processes often involve:
* Manual scripting (Python, Java, etc.) which is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires specialized skills.
* Complex schema mapping challenges between relational/tabular structures and graph (nodes, edges, properties) structures.
* Difficulty in managing incremental updates and ensuring data consistency.
* High cost and long project timelines, hindering graph database adoption.

### 1.3. Vision
To be the industry-leading solution for seamless, automated, and reliable data migration and synchronization between tabular data stores and graph databases, **leveraging AI assistance to dramatically simplify configuration and troubleshooting**, empowering organizations to leverage graph technology faster and more effectively.

### 1.4. Goals & Objectives
* **Reduce Migration Time & Effort:** Decrease the time and technical effort required for tabular-to-graph ETL by at least 70% compared to manual scripting for common use cases.
* **Further Reduce Configuration Complexity:** Utilize LLM capabilities to assist users in schema mapping and potentially transformation logic, reducing manual configuration effort.
* **Lower Barrier to Entry:** Enable data engineers and developers with less graph-specific expertise to perform migrations successfully, **guided by AI suggestions**.
* **Improve Data Quality:** Minimize errors during the transformation process through automation and validation.
* **Increase Flexibility:** Support a range of common tabular sources and graph database targets.
* **Provide Visibility & Actionable Insights:** Offer clear monitoring and logging for ETL processes, **with AI-powered explanations for errors**.

### 1.5. Success Metrics
* Reduction in average project time for pilot customer migrations.
* Time saved in schema mapping configuration (measured via user studies or telemetry).
* Number of successful ETL pipeline executions.
* User satisfaction ratings (Ease of use, Reliability, Helpfulness of AI features).
* Adoption rate (number of connectors used, frequency of runs, usage rate of AI features).
* Reduction in support tickets related to migration errors and configuration questions.
